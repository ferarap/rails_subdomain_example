== Rails subdomain example

This is a little project to test subdomain in rails. 
The idea is create a administration module which is accessed by a specific domain:
link:http://administration.myapp.com

To test this in the development enviroment I use lvh.me, so the url is link:http://administration.lvh.me:3000
